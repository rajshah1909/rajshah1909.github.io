# 👋 Hi, I’m Raj Shah

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at Rutgers University, passionate about data analytics, problem-solving, and visual storytelling.

📈 My goal is to become a data analyst and evolve into a data scientist — driven by curiosity, evidence, and a desire to make an impact.

I’m skilled in **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**, and I enjoy transforming complex data into clear insights. Below are a few projects I’ve completed so far — many of which started in class and were expanded upon independently.
